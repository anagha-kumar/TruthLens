# TruthLens

## Problem
Healthcare research is growing at an unprecedented pace. Every day, new studies, preprints, and news articles make claims about treatments, diets, and medical outcomes. But these claims often **contradict each other** — one paper says a therapy works, another says it doesn’t, and a third says the evidence is inconclusive.  
Clinicians, researchers, and even patients struggle to navigate this noisy landscape. Contradictions create confusion, slow down decision-making, and erode trust in science.

## Why We Need This
- **Information overload:** Thousands of new medical papers are published daily.  
- **Contradictions everywhere:** Conflicting evidence makes it hard to know what to trust.  
- **Time pressure:** Clinicians and researchers don’t have hours to manually compare studies.  
- **Trust gap:** Without clarity, misinformation spreads and confidence in healthcare declines.

## Introducing TruthLens
**TruthLens** is an AI-powered platform that ingests global healthcare research, detects contradictions between claims, and explains them with transparency.  
- **Contradiction detection:** Surfaces when studies disagree.  
- **Consensus building:** Synthesizes the balance of evidence into clear, cited summaries.  
- **Agentic workflows:** Autonomous agents analyze, explain, and answer questions.  
- **Trust-native design:** Every insight comes with source citations, confidence scores, and clear labeling (peer-reviewed, preprint, news).  
- **Inclusive access:** Multilingual ingestion, accessible UI, and plain-language explanations ensure diverse users benefit.

TruthLens gives clinicians, researchers, and students a **lens to see the truth** in healthcare evidence — cutting through contradictions and restoring clarity.
